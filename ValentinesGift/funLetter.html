				OH WHERE TO BEGIN!!! Baby, you are by far the most fun person to be around... Like, I honestly don't undestand how you can be so much fun. I know there are a lot of things that I like to do for fun that you don't necessarily think of as fun, but I seriously have so much fun with you. Sometimes I get kind of confused on the things that we talk about and how we even got to that topic, but I think that's what keeps things entertaining haha. You even told me that I wouldn't ever get bored with you because there's always something that's new and random, and you weren't lying! There's so much that I'm still finding out about you, and it's only gotten better!
			</p>
				Some of the most fun times that I have with you are just when we talk about random stuff and literally go on with that topic for a while until we start asking the question, "how'd we even get to this point in the conversation??" Haha it always makes me laugh even more whenever you make random noises and I just go along with it. I don't want you to feel weird from me doing that, but I just want to join in because they're funny noises and I want to make some along with you!
			<p>
				Having a best friend can be really fun whenever you want it to be and making memories off of nothing but jokes and laughter, because baby, that's what we have and I'm very grateful to God for the privilege to share these times with you. God has shown me what it means to have fun, to enjoy the time that I have while on this earth, and to go and share it with other people; I've been truly blessed to now see that you were the start to beautiful friendships that were to be built up and deepen my roots in, having deeper talks, making memories, but really trying to live godly, and pure lives to our best of abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, to end it off, I just want to say thank you for that and being my best friend, because it was truly an answered prayer.
			</p>

				Like last time, click one of the pictures: The first one goes back to the home page, and the second one will take you the <em>next</em>, and last, yet not the final, reason why I'm so grateful for this relationship.
