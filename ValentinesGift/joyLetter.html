				Naila, it has been such a blessing to have such an amazing best friend such as you. I didn't know who God was going to bring into my life whenever I first started dating you, except that it was more than just off of a whim, but trusting God with my heart. I haven't trusted Him with something so delicate before, obviously, my life as a whole, but my heart is a whole different story... But I'm truly am grateful that I did.
			</p>
				You produce so much joy, Naila, and I don't even think you realize it. You've helped convert hearts that will live at peace from now on, you've helped bring people to the Lord where they will be forever grateful to have you as a friend and sister in Christ, and you've helped me mature and mold me into a more godly man. Every time that I am with you, ever since that day that you said, "yes, I will still date you", I have not been feeling the same to not only you, but God also! I've been brought so much joy from how much love God has truly produced inside of you and had demonstrated through you during the time that you and I were apart. And, even though this was a huge joy to see, the memories that we now have, along side with our previous ones, they're only going to strengthen our relationship as time goes on.
			<p>
				The times that I remember the most where you have brought me the most joy and happiness are when you are playing with children, puppies, looking up at stars, or even when you get flowers from me. Baby, it's such a joy to see your face light up whenever you see the things that God has put on this earth for you to enjoy over everything else. Even during the darkest of times, I see you face light up from the little things that God shows you just to encourage you. Joy is only one of the three words that I will use to describe this relationship and how much I love it, but let me tell you more on the next page. I love you so much!
