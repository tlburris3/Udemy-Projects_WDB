				How I love you... This may be about "love" specifically, but just like the previous reasons, your love has truly made this relationship so much better than anything I could have asked for from a godly relationship. Naila, I'm going to keep saying it and sound like a broken record, but I'm so stinking grateful for this relationship and for the fact that it's been nothing but a pure and godly one. Baby, you have shown me love in so many different areas of this relationship and I cannot thank you enough for how much of an endless effort you have given to demonstrate - <em>not prove, but display it</em> - to me that you love me with your full heart, that it's not partial, but it has always been with your full heart.
			</p>
				This past month has been an emotional rollercoaster, and you and I both can definitely agree and attest to that, but it's been by fart the most impactful month out of our 1 year and 2 month relationship. God worked more during that time than He had throughout the whole duriation of this relationship, not because He hasn't shown how He's worked before in it, but because it was just evident that He was working on our hearts like crazy!
			<p>
				Baby, you have given me love through this whole relationship, I don't want you to think that this was the only time I saw your love for me, but this time was by far the most impactful. It showed me that you have truly wanted to live up to the Scripture we have been trying to live by through this relationship since we went to Dallas - "<strong>Above all</strong>", love each other deeply, <span class="underline">because love covers over a multitude of sins.</span>" (1 Peter 4: 8). You have shown me what it means to live this out, and it's all because Jesus showed it to both us first before we even got into this relationship with each other.
			</p>

				Naila, God has transformed you into a beautiful, amazing, spiritual, lovely, caring, compassionate, driven, salvation-led woman, and I could not have been more blessed to be dating such a holy woman. 
			</p>

				Unfortunately, both of the images lead back to the home page, but it has been such a joyful, fun, and loving adventure with you. Thank you for being my girlfriend and my best friend.
